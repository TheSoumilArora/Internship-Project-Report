# Internship Project Report: Space Vector Modulation

This repository contains the LaTeX files for the internship project report focusing on Space Vector Modulation (SVM). The project report documents the research, analysis, and findings related to Space Vector Modulation techniques.

## Overview

Space Vector Modulation is a technique used in the control of pulse-width modulated inverters to generate three-phase AC voltage waveforms. It is widely used in various applications such as motor control, power electronics, and renewable energy systems.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Witty-Wizard/Intern-Project-Report.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Intern-Project-Report
    ```

3. Open the main.tex file using your preferred LaTeX editor.

## Usage

The LaTeX files can be compiled using a LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX. After making changes to the .tex files, compile the document to generate the PDF output.

## Deployment

The project report is automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions. The built PDF file is available on [GitHub Pages](https://witty-wizard.github.io/Intern-Project-Report/main.pdf).
