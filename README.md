# Internship Project Report: LLC Resonant Converter Design

This repository contains the LaTeX files for the internship project report focusing on LLC Resonant Converter Design. The project report documents the research, analysis, and findings related to LLC Converter Design.

## Overview

LLC resonant converters are a power converter that uses a resonant circuit to store energy and provide a smooth output voltage. These converters utilize resonant circuits, consisting of inductors, capacitors, and switches, to regulate energy flow. They are often used in applications where a high-quality, ripple-free output voltage is required.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheSoumilArora/Internship-Project-Report.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Internship-Project-Report
    ```

3. Open the main.tex file using your preferred LaTeX editor.

## Usage

The LaTeX files can be compiled using a LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX. After making changes to the .tex files, compile the document to generate the PDF output.

## Deployment

The project report is automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions. The built PDF file is available on [GitHub Pages](https://thesoumilarora.github.io/Internship-Project-Report/main.pdf).
