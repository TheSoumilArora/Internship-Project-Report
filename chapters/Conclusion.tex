\section{Conclusion}
Throughout my internship at Statcon Electronics India Ltd., I gained extensive
knowledge and practical experience in understanding, testing, and designing
LLC based resonant converters. This journey involved understanding and applying
the transition from simulation to real hardware implementation.

\noindent
LLC Resonant converters offers several advantages over conventional SMPS based
converters, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Higher Efficiency}: Resonant converters are more efficient than non-resonant converters because they can operate at a higher switching frequency. This reduces the amount of energy lost in the switching process.
    \item \textbf{Low Ripple}: Resonant converters can produce a lower ripple output voltage than non-resonant converters. This is because the resonant circuit acts as a filter, removing high-frequency components from the output voltage.
    \item \textbf{Wide Bandwidth}: Resonant converters can operate over a wide bandwidth. This means that they can be used with a variety of input and output voltages.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Moreover, the hands-on experience with simulation tools like LtSpice
and practical circuits involving high DC voltage (upto 400V) and the complete
motherboard circuit has enriched my understanding of both simulation and
hardware aspects of power electronics. This dual exposure has equipped
me with a holistic view of the challenges and solutions in modern power
converters technology.

\section{Future Scope}
The knowledge and skills developed during this internship have broad
applications in various fields, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integrated Power Supplies}: The primary use case of this LLC based resonant converter is the Integrated Power Supplies (IPS) for the railways for our company in which 4 (or more) of such converters are wired up in parallel and then used to power the load.
    \item \textbf{Telecom Power Supplies}: These converters can be used in telecom power supplies where the load is highly dynamic and the power supply needs to be efficient and reliable.
    \item \textbf{Battery Charging}: Since our design has variable output voltage with active voltage and current control, we can use it for battery charging applications in electric vehicles.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Overall, this internship has been a valuable learning experience, providing me
with the technical expertise and practical skills needed to contribute
effectively to the field of power electronics. The insights gained have not only
broadened my knowledge base but also ignited a passion for further exploration
and innovation in this dynamic and impactful field.
