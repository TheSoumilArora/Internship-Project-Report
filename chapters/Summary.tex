I got the opportunity to do my internship at Statcon Electronics India Ltd.
Statcon Electronics established in 1986 is one of India's largest ISO
9001-20151 certified manufacturer of Static energy Conversion systems. During my
internship at Statcon Electronics India Ltd, Noida, I was first assigned to
explore LLC Converters and then make a simulation for the various circuits in the 
exisiting converters using LtSpice. I was part of the Hardware Design team and
my task was to develop a LLC Resonant Converter according to the required specifications.\\
\\
The aim of the project was to design a LLC Resonant converter for a IPS (Integrated
Power Supply) for railways, providing efficienct power while reducing
harmonic distortions and improving the power factor.

\section{Timeline}
My internship at Statcon Electronics India Ltd started on 2nd January, 2024.
My mentor gave me the task of exploring LLC Converters and developing such
converter as per the given specifications. This timeline will briefly
explain the course of my internship from beginning to end.

\subsection{January}
In January, I started learning about LLC Converters and simulating control
circuits in LtSpice. This involved understanding the basics of Switching
Mode Power Supplies (SMPS), LC tank circuits, LLC topology for SMPS, etc.
This exploration gave me a better grasp of how an LLC resonant converter
works and its uses in power supplies.

\subsection{Feburary}
During February, I immersed myself in the study and testing of the exisiting
LLC converter deeply understanding the working of the converter in much more
detail and what all factors need to be taken care of when we design such a
power supply. The work that I did included study of, preparing (such as
soldering the components etc.), finding and fixing the bugs that were arising
in the hardware (such as issue of noise in feedback signals etc.).

\subsection{March}
During March, apart from the ongoing work in the testing of the motherboard and
control circuit, I worked on developing the testing jig for the LLC converter
which would be used when the converter is put into production in the company.

\subsection{April}

\subsection{May}

\subsection{June}
